**Interview Questions Per Team Member Per Recipes** 


| Ngan | Tianna | Ruth | 
| What ingredients are required for the chicken soup recipe? | How does the robot identify and handle the various ingredients required for a Chef salad, such as veggies, proteins, and dressings? | Can you provide a detailed description of the chili and rice recipe, including all the ingredients and their quantities? |
| Can users enter the quantity of each ingredient, or will it be preset? | How does the robot ensure accurate portion control for each ingredient in the salad? | What specific cooking techniques are required for this recipe, and should the RT5000 perform any of these tasks? |
| Does the robot have to prep any of the ingredients (i.e. wash, peel, or chop)? | What features does the robot have that ensure quality and freshness for ingredients in the Chef salad? | Are there any variations or dietary restrictions we should consider when preparing this dish? |
| What are the cooking methods involved in making the chicken soup (boil, simmer)? | What measures are taken to ensure food safety and hygiene standards are met during the preparation of the Chef Salad? | Can you clarify how the RT5000's app is expected to assist in this cooking process? |
| Can users set cooking time and temperature through the app? | Can the robot and it's app hold different variations of the Chef salad and handle future updates to the recipe? | What kind of input options does the app offer for selecting the recipe and customizing cooking parameters? |
| Can users customize the recipe by adjusting ingredient quantities or adding their own? | Is there a feature made on the robot and its app dedicated to customer feedback on the Chef salad? | Are there any safety measures or considerations for handling hot ingredients or equipment that the RT5000 should be aware of? |
| Will the robot need to pause at certain steps for user interactions (i.e. tasting and adjusting seasoning) | What is the robot’s process for assembling the Chef salad as far as ingredient placement and presentation? | How is the robot expected to interact with kitchen appliances and utensils while preparing this dish? |
| Will the app notify the user when the soup is ready? If so, how?| Is the robot’s app designed to allow users to customize their Chef salad? If so, how does the customization work? | Can you specify any specific timing or sequencing requirements for the RT5000's actions during the recipe preparation? |
| Are users able to specify how they want the robot to notify them when the soup is done? | How does the robot and its app interact with users? Does it provide information to users about the progress of their salad? | Are there any potential challenges or complexities in this recipe that the RT5000 should be able to handle, such as stirring, chopping, or adjusting heat levels? |
| How does the robot indicate that its task is done and ready for the next step? | What steps are taken to minimize food waste in the preparation of the Chef salad? | What are the desired outcomes and quality standards for the final dish, and how will the RT5000 be evaluated based on these criteria? |
